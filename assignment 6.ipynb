    "## Question 1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.  \n"

    "## Question 2: List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify."

    "\n",
    "1. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "2. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data)."

    "* **Class**:  A class is a template of general structure for creating objects (a particular data structure). e.g. car, human can be a class.\n",
    "* **Object**: An object is a specific instance having its own state created using particular class. e.g. audi is an object of class car, Jake is an object of class human.\n",
    "* **Atribute**: Attribute defines the state of object of a class. They store the information about the instance or object e.g. name, age, colour are attributes.\n",
